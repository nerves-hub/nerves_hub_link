# Configuration

## Runtime configuration

`NervesHubLink` also supports runtime configuration via the `NervesHubLink.Configurator` behavior. This is called during application startup to build the configuration that is to be used for the connection. When implementing the behavior, you'll receive the initial default config read in from the application environment and you can modify it however you need.

This is useful for cases like:

- selectively choosing which cert/key to use
- reading a certificate file stored on the device which isn't available during compilation

For example:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Configurator do
  @behaviour NervesHubLink.Configurator

  @impl NervesHubLink.Configurator
  def build(config) do
    ssl = [certfile: "/root/ssl/cert.pem", keyfile: "/root/ssl/key.pem"]
    %{config | ssl: ssl}
  end
end
```

Then you specify which configurator `NervesHubLink` should use in `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, configurator: MyApp.Configurator
```

## Retrying firmware downloads

Firmware and Archive downloads are resilient to network issues and can be retried automatically.

You can configure how the Downloader handles timeouts, disconnections, and other aspects of the
retry logic by adding the following configuration to your application's config file:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, :retry_config,
  max_disconnects: 20,
  idle_timeout: 75_000,
  max_timeout: 10_800_000
```

For more information about the configuration options, see the `NervesHubLink.Downloader.RetryConfig` module.

## Conditionally applying updates

It's not always appropriate to apply a firmware update immediately. Custom logic can be added to the device by
implementing the `NervesHubLink.Client` behaviour and telling NervesHubLink to use it. eg.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.NervesHubLinkClient do
   @behaviour NervesHubLink.Client

   # May return:
   #  * `:apply` - apply the action immediately
   #  * `:ignore` - don't apply the action, don't ask again.
   #  * `{:reschedule, timeout_in_milliseconds}` - call this function again later.

   @impl NervesHubLink.Client
   def update_available(data) do
    if SomeInternalAPI.is_now_a_good_time_to_update?(data) do
      :apply
    else
      {:reschedule, 60_000}
    end
   end
end
```

To have NervesHubLink use it, update your `config.exs` as follows:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, client: MyApp.NervesHubLinkClient
```

## Reporting update progress

See the previous section for implementing a `client` behaviour.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.NervesHubLinkClient do
  @behaviour NervesHubLink.Client
  #  argument can be:
  #   {:ok, non_neg_integer(), String.t()}
  #   {:warning, non_neg_integer(), String.t()}
  #   {:error, non_neg_integer(), String.t()}
  #   {:progress, 0..100}
  def handle_fwup_message({:ok, _, _}) do
    Logger.error("Firmware update complete")
    :ok
  end

  def handle_fwup_message({:warning, code, message}) do
    Logger.error("Warning while applying firmware update (#{code)}): #{message}")
    :ok
  end

  def handle_fwup_message({:error, _, message}) do
    Logger.error("Error while applying firmware update #(#{code}): {message}")
    :ok
  end

  def handle_fwup_message({:progress, progress}) when rem(progress, 10) do
    Logger.info("Update progress: #{progress}%")
    :ok
  end

  def handle_fwup_message({:progress, _}) do
    :ok
  end
end
```

## Enabling remote IEx access

It's possible to remotely log into your device via the NervesHub web interface. This feature is disabled by default. To enable, add the following to your `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, remote_iex: true
```

The remote IEx process is started on the first data request from NervesHub and is terminated after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can adjust this by setting `:remote_iex_timeout` value in seconds in your `config.exs`:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, remote_iex_timeout: 900 # 15 minutes
```

You may also need additional permissions on NervesHub to see the device and to use the remote IEx feature.

## Alarms

This application can set and clear the following alarms:

- `NervesHubLink.Disconnected`
  - set: An issue is preventing a connection to NervesHub or one just hasn't been made yet
  - clear: Currently connected to NervesHub
- `NervesHubLink.UpdateInProgress`
  - set: A new firmware update is being downloaded or applied
  - clear: No updates are happening

## CA Certificates

The CA certificates installed on the device are used by default.

If you include the [CAStore](https://hex.pm/packages/castore) in your project, then that will be selected and used.

Otherwise you can configure `nerves_hub_link` to use custom CA certificates, which is useful if you are running your own NervesHub instance with self signed SSL certificates. Use the `:ca_store` option to specify a module with a `ca_certs/0` function that returns a list of DER encoded certificates:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, ca_store: MyModule
```

Or if you have the certificates in DER format, you can also explicitly set them in the :ssl option:

```elixir
my_der_list = [<<213, 34, 234, 53, 83, 8, 2, ...>>]
config :nerves_hub_link, ssl: [cacerts: my_der_list]
```

## Verifying network availability

`NervesHubLink` will attempt to verify that the network is available before initiating the first connection attempt. This is done by checking if the `NervesHub` host address (`config.host`) can be resolved. If the network isn't available then the check will be run again in 2 seconds.

You can disable this behaviour with the following config:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, connect_wait_for_network: false
```

## Disable `NervesHubLink` during testing

To disable `NervesHubLink` connecting to `NervesHub` when testing, you can add:

```elixir
config :nerves_hub_link, connect: false
```

to your `config/test.exs`
